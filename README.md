# Inconsistent Tailwind CSS Styling

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS styles are not applied consistently across different components or browser versions. The issue manifests as missing background colors, padding, or rounded corners in certain cases, even when the correct classes are applied.

## Bug Description
A simple div with Tailwind classes for background color, padding, and rounded corners occasionally does not render correctly. This inconsistency might occur in different browser versions or due to interaction with other CSS rules.

## Solution
The solution might involve adjusting the CSS specificity, ensuring that Tailwind's CSS is loaded correctly, and carefully checking for any conflicting CSS rules.  Also, verify that your Tailwind configuration is correct and up-to-date.
